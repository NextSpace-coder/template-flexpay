            The CFO is ascending. Earlier this year, Fortune reported that in the first half of 2023, 8.1% of CFOs at Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies were promoted to CEO up from 5.4% a decade earlier. The jump reflects how business success and financial agility have become inseparable.

            Revenue recovery is a key part of how Stripe Billing maximizes revenue. We use machine learning to retry failed recurring payments at the optimal time, based on hundreds of dynamic signals. Our Smart Retries algorithm continuously gets better, and we've improved the recovery rate by 38% in 2023.

            One of the best ways for businesses to grow revenue is to enter new markets, but they're often stymied by the tax complexity that comes with it. We built Stripe Tax to solve that problem. Businesses can sell cross-border and tax takes care of tax collection for them, automatically. Now, tax just got better, with support for 16 new countries (bringing the total number of countries supported to 50, including all of the EU).
